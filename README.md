# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m Adrien

## I help businesses grow by transforming data into actionable insights

Iâ€™m a fully trained Data Analyst with a business background. I completed Le Wagonâ€™s intensive bootcamp, gaining hands-on experience with data tools such as SQL, Python, Power BI, DBT, and more. I also mastered key data processes like ETL, automation, and data visualization through real business projects.

My experience at tech companies like Revolut and Microsoft taught me how to thrive in fast-paced environments. I now leverage my technical and business skills to help sales, marketing, and operations teams make sense of data.
